# SC1015-Mini-Project-Group-2

## About

This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on a Smartphone Sales Dataset by Yamin Hossain from [https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yaminh/smartphone-sale-dataset/data). 
For detailed walkthrough, please view the source code in order from:

1. [Data Extraction]
2. [Data Visualization]
3. [Logistic Regression]

## Problem Definition

- How do different smartphone features or variables affect the ratings of each smartphone?
- Which model would be the best to predict it?

## Models Used

1. Decision Tree
2. Gradient Boosting
3. Random Forest
4. K-Nearest Neighbours

## Conclusion

- SELLING_PRICE AND ORIGINAL_PRICE have a positive linear correlation value with RATING.
- The best algorithm to be used to predict RATING of Mobile Phones is the Random Forest Algorithm.
- The Top 5 Important Features to predict RATING are: "ORIGINAL_PRICE", "BRANDS_APPLE", "SELLING_PRICE", "STORAGE_32_GB" and "BRANDS_LG".



## What did we learn from this project?

- Decision Tree, Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbours from SKLEARN
- Collaborating with teammates via GitHub
